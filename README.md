# README - WebDev

## Purpose
This repository holds all of the quizzes, assignments, and practice work I have completed as a part of Colt Steele's
*The Web Developer Bootcamp* found on Udemy. The course has lectures and assignments that fully cover HTML, CSS, Javascript,
Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, jQuery, NodeJS, REST, Express, and Mongo among other topics relevant to creating and deploying web applications.


#### The work in this repository is completely my own and was completed as I progressed throughout the course.
